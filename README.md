This is a flutter Chat application with firebase auth and firestore integration
Please note that the application isn't fully responsive, I used iphone 11 emulator when developing it.

In firestore I had a User collection and within each document a Conversations collection. Inside that you'll find the messages collection (check the classes for each collection to find out more).
